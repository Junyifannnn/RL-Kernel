# Configurable H100 consistency runs

From the configured RL-Kernel checkout, use the local `rlk` entry point. The
machine's Python, framework, checkpoint and dataset paths are read from
`.rlk-profile.json`; they do not need to appear in each command.

```bash
# Two training steps, including real weight updates and automatic validation.
./rlk verify --tp 2 --rollout-tp 4 --temperature 0.7 --top-p 0.95

# Top-k is independent of top-p and temperature.
./rlk verify --tp 4 --rollout-tp 2 --temperature 1.3 --top-p 0.99 --top-k 128

# A longer run with explicit training CP and output length.
./rlk run --tp 2 --cp 4 --rollout-tp 4 --temperature 0.7 --top-p 0.95 \
    --steps 200 --max-response-len 6912

# Same topology with native operators for performance comparison.
./rlk verify --mode native --tp 2 --rollout-tp 4 --temperature 0.7 --top-p 0.95
```

Training TP can be 1, 2, 4 or 8 on this eight-GPU Qwen3-8B profile. If `--cp`
is omitted it is inferred as `8 / TP`; explicit `TP * CP` must equal eight.
Rollout TP can be chosen independently and must divide the GPU count. Engine
counts and CUDA Graph batch sizes are derived from the chosen topology.
Rollout CP is currently limited to 1: vLLM 0.16 FlashAttention does not
implement prefill context parallelism. A larger value fails before launch.
This restriction does not apply to training CP. The launcher also rejects
submission while GPUs have existing compute processes; it cannot reserve
the GPUs against other users starting a process later.
When both training TP and rollout TP are 1, the launcher offloads the training
state during rollout to fit the model, optimizer and KV cache on 80 GB GPUs.
This memory tradeoff is recorded in the manifest and affects throughput.

`--temperature` accepts finite nonnegative values; zero selects greedy
sampling. `--top-p` accepts `(0, 1]`. `--top-k` accepts `-1` (disabled) or a
positive integer up to the real vocabulary size. Full top-p/top-k support is
computed from the real vocabulary, so API top-logprob limits do not truncate
the distribution. Both sides use float32 temperature scaling after the same
BF16 model logits. The rollout adapter also handles per-request temperatures.

The default mode is `consistency`, with no `--use-rollout-logprobs`. `verify`
defaults to two steps, 512 response tokens, learning rate `5e-7`, and KL
coefficient `0.01`; all these values can be overridden. The KL reference is
temperature-scaled over the full vocabulary, rather than independently
truncated: a different reference nucleus can otherwise assign zero
probability to a sampled policy token. The policy logprob retains its actual
top-p/top-k sampling support. This choice is recorded in the run manifest.

Both `run` and `verify` wait by default and automatically run acceptance
checks. `--detach` submits without waiting. `--steps`, `--lr`, `--kl-coef`,
`--weight-decay`, `--max-response-len`, and `--run-id` are ordinary parameters;
the longer existing flag names remain accepted.

Validation checks include the complete expected step sequence, successful Ray
termination, finite training metrics, exact policy/rollout logprobs, and
sidecar sample/token coverage. `verify` additionally requires a nonzero
gradient, positive learning rates and changed bytes in an exported weight
tensor across versions. A one-step run cannot satisfy that update check.

Results are stored under the configured output root in an append-only run
directory, with `manifest.json`, `run.log`, `ray-status.txt`,
`run-validation.json`, mismatch sidecars and weight fingerprints. The manifest
records effective sampling, topology, revisions, patches and runtime paths.
Use `./rlk plan` to inspect the fully expanded command before running.

Each configuration's train/rollout equality is distinct from requiring
identical training trajectories across different configurations: engine
scheduling and random sampling can change the data even when logprob kernels
are bitwise invariant. Even with the same first-step tokens, changing training
TP/CP can change backward reductions and the updated weight bytes. This launcher
validates train/rollout logprob bytes within each run; it does not certify
cross-configuration optimizer trajectories. In the two-step H100 checks, all
responses were truncated and the nonzero gradients came from the KL term;
longer training with nonzero reward advantages remains a separate validation.

Train offload keeps IPC arenas in independent resident allocation pools. This
also applies when the offload hook is currently disabled: the default allocator
can still contain cached VMM blocks that cannot be exported as CUDA IPC handles.
